# JAMAI Input Parser

The inputParser/ module is the core for language, emotion, and symbolic command parsing in JAMAI.

- Connects voice/text input to musical intent and emotion.
- Handles natural language prompts, ABC notation, and symbolic directives.
- Enables dynamic, conversational music creation and correction.

_Example:_
- Parse: “add longing,” “slower,” or “score like a prayer.”
- Route parsed intent to emotionEngine or formatConversion modules.
