# JAMAI Interactive Module

The interactive/ module powers the conversational feedback loop in JAMAI.

- Supports real-time corrections, refinements, and session memory.
- Enables users to adjust, vary, or evolve music through dialogue (text or voice).
- Integrates with emotionEngine and inputParser for emotionally dynamic responses.

_Example:_
- “Make it brighter,” “add more swing,” “repeat last phrase.”
- Maintain conversational state for iterative music creation.
